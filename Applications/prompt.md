Hiring Committee  
Ansys  
Vancouver, BC  

Dear Hiring Committee,

I’m James Han, a third-year Computer Science student at the University of Toronto with a deep passion for building fast, intelligent systems—and I’m excited to apply for the Spring 2026 Software Development Intern – Data Science role at Ansys.

Although the role is listed for MS students, I bring hands-on experience that aligns strongly with your expectations. I’ve led data-heavy projects and built production-grade tools across research, civic tech, and startups. At the U of T Computer Science Department, I enhanced AST parsing and integrated linters like pylint and mypy into *PythonTA*, a static analysis tool used by 1,500+ students. I also built *Markyt*, a real-time SvelteKit platform for influencer-business matchmaking, with Firebase, Stripe, and webhooks driving the backend.

On the data science side, I’ve worked with Databricks and ML pipelines to win hackathons, including a satellite disaster response app (90% image classification accuracy on 100K+ data points) and an OpenCV-based language tutor with real-time feedback that won Google’s Hack the Future. I’m fluent in Python, SQL, and cloud development, and I learn tools like Spark or Power BI quickly when needed.

Ansys’ vision of advancing human progress through simulation deeply resonates with me. I’d be honored to contribute to your data science initiatives and help accelerate innovation at scale.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
James Han
